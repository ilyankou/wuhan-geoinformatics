## Introduction 


Place Connectivity Index (PCI) based on spatial interactions among places can provide valuable insights in flow of population with respect to time. PCI offers a unique lens through which to examine the complex factors influencing the COVID-19 pandemic. This study seeks to investigate the relationship between PCI and the pandemic's impact.

While it is often assumed that areas with higher PCI will have a higher population density, Higher movements (flow of moving population),  leading to a higher death rate, higher PCI is also associated with higher economic and educational levels, which may enable these areas to better combat the pandemic.

## Objective

This study aims to investigate the relationship between Place Connectivity Index (PCI) and the death ratio of COVID-19, with a focus on how this relationship changes over time and varies by different factors including availablity of hospitals , wealth of residing people in the area. Specifically, our objectives are to:

- We are trying to understand which are the cities with High PCI , Are they wealthier ? Do they have more infrastructure , Does the covid death count reacted accordnigly or in contrast ?

### PCI 
Place Connectivity Index : 
Measure of spatial interactions among places due to intense human movement.

### GWR 

Geographically weighted regression (GWR): It is a spatial analysis technique that takes non-stationary variables into consideration (e.g., climate; demographic factors; physical environment characteristics) and models the local relationships between these predictors and an outcome of interest.
